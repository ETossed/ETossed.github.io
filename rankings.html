                    Introduction

                <p>
                    I figured I'd make my own ranking because I was gonna do a top 100 ballot whether or not I ended up 
                    getting an ballot at the end of year, because I love ranking and tiering things. Do not take this 
                    as a replacement for the SSBMRank, they do an amazing job over there and they have so many panelists 
                    who I trust more than myself to rank things. Ranking the top 100 is a super hard process and any complaints people have
                    about where certain players finish are super valid.
                    <br><br> 
                    Anyways, here's the methodology I tried to stick by:
                    <ul>- Placements don't matter except for first and maybe second</ul>
                    <ul>- H2Hs matter a lot</ul>
                    <ul>- Consistency matters a lot</ul>
                    <ul>- Good wins valued more than bad losses, especially in dominant H2Hs</ul>
                    <ul>- Tried to value attendance</ul>
                    <ul>- Using exact same eligibility list as SSBMRank 2022</ul>
                    <ul>- Losses at locals don't matter, wins do a teeny tiny bit (Please attend your locals)</ul>

                    The blurbs under each top 100 player I tried to keep somewhat "official" but also explain my reasoning for a lot of placements,
                    some more than others. Hopefully this can limit some of the questions, but I did my best, I'm not a writer by trade.
                    It was also very tiring and I did the blurbs for the best ranked players first, so the top 40ish are actually pretty good I think.
                    (and ChuDat's). Big shoutout to Rochester TO legend Silo5000 for writing some blurbs, it saved me quite a bit of time.
                    His blurbs are marked as such, all others were mine.
                    <br><br>

                    I designed and coded this website from scratch (There's even lightmode in the top right corner, which I assume 
                    only DarkGenex will use), the <span class="rc">accent color</span> is random (refresh the page for fun), and the button 
                    below toggles showing the blurbs below each ranking card. This is not an algorithmic ranking, this is what my ballot 
                    would have been. The source code of this website and the H2H preadsheet I used to create this ranking are 
                    both linked at the bottom of the page

                    <br><br>

                    The first section is honorable mentions for those who just barely missed the top 100, then the section after is the top 100.

                    Matteo is a longtime Captain Falcon player from Ontario, Canada who had a string of 
                    impressive tournament runs this summer. Most notably, An incredible 13th place finish 
                    at Super Smash Con. After getting DQd in round 1 pools, Matteo would win an astounding 
                    11 sets in a row, including set wins on Darktooth, Ringler, Lunar Dusk and JJM. Not 
                    just a one run wonder, Matteo would also accrue wins over Wally, Pleeba and Kuyashi 
                    at other events this year.

                    The Champaign, Illinois fox main was a regional grinder this year, picking up 
                    wins on essy (2-0), Q?, Pleeba, Preeminent, Reesch, and Ringler. He ended the 
                    year super strong, winning BOPME 22 without dropping a set, over players like 
                    Michael, Blue, and Preeminent. Looking forward to seeing more of him next year.

                    If you think the Donkey Kong revolution isn't here, then you haven't been paying 
                    attention. For a while Ringler has been quietly improving their craft, and it all 
                    came to a head at Wavedash, when Ringler would score back to back set wins against 
                    Nickemwit and KJH, finishing 17th overall. A week later Ringler would also take a set 
                    win over Bobby Big Ballz at Super Smash Con. Ringler's Donkey Kong might be a mainstay 
                    in 2023's top 64 brackets to come.

                    For those of you who watch Verdugo and other Socal locals, you know that Nut is a 
                    force to be reckoned with. Despite only traveling out of Socal a few times this year, 
                    Nut would consistently earn impressive wins, including players like Mekk, Prince Abu, 
                    Iceman and others. No slouch on the homefront either, Nut would beat Kurv at Wavedash 
                    and Bonfire10 at Mainstage and Gooms at The New Mang over the course of the year.

                    Despite attending a smaller number than usual of tournaments, Free Palestine still 
                    showed that he was a tough opponent. At regionals Free Palestine would beat players 
                    such as Slowking, Squid and Kuyashi. Free Palestine only found himself at a few 
                    majors this year but made the time count. At Riptide he would beat Eggy and at Big 
                    House he'd take sets over Panda, Captain G and Darkatma. Regardless of his level of 
                    activity, Free Palestine is still a force to be reckoned with.

                    Eggy is a Chicago peach who made a splash by beating moky at Genesis and then 
                    was pretty quiet in terms of top 100 wins after that. They did pick up a Wally 
                    win at Shine, as well as Q? and JoJo wins this year, both players who were on the 
                    ballot. If eggy can replicate that success he had against moky, he could be scary going forward.

                    Kevin Maples was one of the fastest rising young players prior to the pandemic, and 
                    halfway through the year, he returned to competition at LAN events. He won sets 
                    against variety of players including Jflex, Juicebox, Dawson (x2), Warmmer and Reeve. 
                    If he continues this trend it's clear that Kevin Maples can surpass his previous peaks 
                    and become much higher ranked by next year.

                    The first time I saw JustJoe play, my first reaction was, “wow, he's so fast”. This 
                    ultra technical fox had a breakout second half of the year, with wins over Ben, Eggy, essy, 
                    Free Palestine, and more. He's taken games from players like Jmook and Fiction, so we 
                    know he can do it. Look out for one of Chicago's best in 2023.

                    JJM had the sickest combo of the year on Dawson at No Jawns 2. Seriously, 
                    if you didn't see it, please go look it up. Oh, he also won that event. The 
                    towering Ice Climbers main with a peach secondary is on the come up, with wins 
                    over null, 2saint, Ben, and more. His second half of the year was better than 
                    his first, watch out for him in 2023.

                    Logos didn't attend much, but when he did, he made his presence felt. The Utah 
                    Falco's best performance was at Edgeguard II: Fight II Fright where he double 
                    eliminated Spark to win after losing to him earlier in bracket. He was also able 
                    to pick up a null win at Mainstage a month later. If he keeps traveling and carries 
                    his momentum into 2023, he'll be scary to fight in bracket.

                    Essy was incredibly well traveled this year. If there was a large regional near Ohio, 
                    she probably attended it. The Sheik/Fox main, who also has secondaries of ICs and 
                    Marth (who have both been used in tournaments a lot this year), picked up a lot of 
                    wins on players like Ben, Drephen, Mad Tyro, and KJH. But, she's also missing a 
                    signature win in the top 30 range that some players around her have. However, her 
                    resume with such amazing attendance is definitely still enough to land her a spot 
                    on the top 100.

                    I hope Khalid doesn't threaten to sue me for his ranking position. #1 in San 
                    Diego's year was one filled with a lot of results. He's got good wins over players 
                    like Suf, Eddy Mexico, Ben, and Faceroll. He's only got one loss to a player not on 
                    the ballot, MegaXmas, but he's lacking a super signature top 30 win that many players 
                    above him have.

                    Formerly known as NMW, Nickemwit's falcon play has been mostly confined to west 
                    coast events (besides Sunshined 2, which was in Missouri lol). Wins on TheSWOOPER, 
                    Kalamazhu, and Aura show that he can definitely still hang with top level players after 
                    almost playing for 10 years, he's gotta clean up some losses to players like Zbert and 
                    Zeo if he wants to be higher next year, but it wouldn't be that surprising, we know he's 
                    capable of it.

                    A Young Link from Chile made it onto the top 100. Imagine telling someone that even 
                    two years ago. His highlight of the year was double eliminating Spark to win SPC: Rehab 
                    2.0 while he was staying in Arizona. On top of that, pretty good performances at majors 
                    have led to Rocket being the first Young Link and only the 2nd/3rd Chilean to ever make 
                    the top 100.

                    TheRealThing has quietly proven himself to be one of the best midwest falcos. 
                    Though he only left his native state of Ohio twice, he would earn wins against Lunar Dusk, 
                    Q?, Smashdaddy and Preeminent while staying remarkably consistent. In his home state, he 
                    kept up with the the best, and if he gets more chances to prove himself I can see him 
                    moving quite far up the rankings.

                    I remember seeing a tweet in the first half of the year from Edwin Budding asking: 
                    “Which Luigi's resume is better?” and it was Eddy Mexico vs Mad Tyro, anonymously. 
                    Mad Tyro handily won. However, he didn't attend enough to be put on the ballot. His first 
                    half of the year was incredibly strong, with wins over Pipsqueak, Skerzo, Grab, 2-0 on Zamu, 
                    and more. However, his second half of the year didn't live up to the first, which is why he 
                    finds himself in the 80s and not in the 40s.

                    Voo has proven themselves to be a strong and consistent falco hailing from South Florida. 
                    Attending only a handful of majors, they made their mark every time. Beating players like 
                    Chem, Khryke and Kuya they also made a major upset at Low Tide City, beating Magi in a 2-1 set.

                    Siremeris is a player I didn't even have on my radar this year. You're telling me there 
                    are melee players in West Virginia? Apparently, his peach is NASTY. Picking up wins 
                    on Magi, Lunar Dusk, essy, and more, his only losses to players around his Caliber is an 
                    0-4 record against Drephen at regionals. He's a player I'd definitely look out for in 2023.

                    For a long while Gahtzu was a constant in the top 32 brackets of any given major. 
                    And while it appears he's taken a step back on the sheer number of Majors he's chosen 
                    to attend, it's clear that the poise and discipline to remain a top level threat never went 
                    away. At Big House alone he beat Ginger, Salt, Duck and Ringler, which on it's own 
                    would be enough to be considered for this list. But Gahtzu was also able to add SDJ 
                    (x2) Free Palestine, Wevans and Kuya before the end of the year. Anything can happen in 
                    the future of Melee, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if Gahtzu is able to keep winning 
                    big sets in 2023 and remind everyone who he is.

                    Soy homero. Todos somos homeros. Red Bull enthusiast Chape finds himself as the highest 
                    ranked South American player. Thanks to Melee Stats, he's been able to attend a bunch of 
                    events this year, picking up wins like Mekk, Aura, and Eddy Mexico. He's really prolific 
                    at the sheik matchup, so don't be surprised to see him making a deep run the next time 
                    he's in the US if he gets the right bracket. I'm praying for a bunch of Yoshis and Dr Marios 
                    for him (that's not a joke).

                    I won't speak for anyone else, but prior to Shine 2022 I was unfamiliar with Panko's game. 
                    Beating Magi, Eggy and KoDoRiN all in a row to make it to winners quarters as a unranked 
                    player is nothing short of an incredible feat. Before the end of the year, Panko would add 
                    a few wins against Pleeba and Voo, along with a Logan win that was actually a month prior 
                    to the incredible Shine run.

                    at Super Smash Con. Wins over Ryobeat, moky, and BBatts netted him a 9th place finish at the 
                    second most entered major of the year, only losing to the brothers Rishi and lloD. Hopefully 
                    we'll see him attend more stuff next year and he should be higher.

                    major of the year was Big House 10, where he'd beat Null to place 33rd. His other wins at 
                    regionals include Typhoon, Casper, Franz, nut and Reesch.

                    How long has Drephen been playing for? And he's still this good? Wow. Drephen mostly 
                    traveled around the midwest this year, with strong performances including 1st at The 
                    Homie Round, 2nd at Show Me Your Moves, 3rd at THREEVO, and 7th at We Need Some Space. 
                    Not to mention, he got a n0ne win at Super Smash Con! I know he's got a kid on the way 
                    (or had one recently) so hopefully we'll still see him in 2023.

                    Kalvar was an exceptionally well traveled player this year, attending 8 
                    different majors and a slew of New England regionals. At these regionals 
                    Kalvar would win sets against players like Bonfire10, Warmmer and bobby big ballz. 
                    At majors Kalvar would bring a good deal of heat as well, winning sets against Dawson, 
                    Younger, JoJo and a few big name Spacies; Lucky and Skerzo. I wouldn't be surprised if 
                    this trend continues and we see Kalvar continue to take bigger names leading into 
                    2023 while grinding tournaments of all sizes.

                    The nicest guy in the community. I've never heard anyone say anything bad about 
                    Eddy Mexico, and he plays A MID TIER. A really strong first half of the year led 
                    to a 49th on the MPGR, but his second half of the year left more to be desired. At 
                    this point though, the most important thing is that he's almost undoubtedly the 
                    best Luigi of all time, and we couldn't have a better representative for a character.

                    Another player who's super hard to evaluate, he had a pretty good first half of 
                    the year, with the best point coming at CEO when he beat Hbox. After his two 
                    tournaments in the second half of the year, SSC and Wavedash, Kalindi has been 
                    going all Falco in practice, and it's been improving a lot, so don't be surprised 
                    to see his bird flying next year.

                    Kzhu was pretty inactive this year, but his year started off great with a 7th at 
                    Genesis… and then he didn't attend anything until August. However, his second half 
                    of the year wasn't as good, with losses to Eddy Mexico, Nickemwit, and then a pair 
                    of two inactive sheiks (Duck and Shroomed, neither of which are that bad). He's 
                    been in the game for so long though that I wouldn't doubt to see him return to 
                    another major top 8 next year.

                    The philly puff is #2 on the power rankings there only behind SluG, which is nothing 
                    to scoff at. He's been very consistent this year. It seems like every major he went 
                    to beat one really good player and lost to a player around his caliber. He's 
                    gotta clean up his regional performances if he wants to find himself higher next 
                    year, but he can definitely do it. Never forget when some redditor asked “Who are 
                    all of these panelists?” for the MPGR in an attack piece, and included Dawson, a 
                    literal top 100 player.

                    shoot up on the rankings when he does. One last thing: Oh, he's also a popoff king 
                    just like HGod himself too. He jumped off stage when he beat SDJ at Low Tide City and 
                    got so much air he might have been able to dunk (probably not).

                    The highlight of Billy's year has to be Fete 2, where he beat Jah Ridin, Fat Tino, and 
                    Spark, en route to a 4th place finish at an overseas major, an amazing showing for an 
                    American who's probably jetlagged as hell. However, the second half of the year wasn't 
                    as good for him and he didn't attend any of the three supermajors this year, so it's 
                    really hard to judge his skill against a lot of the other top 100. Can straight batts 
                    harness some of his heterosexual energy and improve even more next year?

                    Wally was impossible to rank. How do you rank a guy whose metrics are all over the 
                    place… but he's got a Zain win? I don't know. Wally has shown us the ability to beat 
                    literally anyone (and I mean anyone) but he seems to be in a bit of a slump right now. 
                    Don't be surprised to see him shoot up the rankings next year.

                    Yes, this is the third New Jersey player in a row. No, I did not rig it. No, I do not 
                    know their PR and I refuse to look it up because that would seem like a bad idea to 
                    order them in that direction. Anyways, Mot$ did decently well at majors this year, but 
                    he shined at regionals, getting 1st at The Flying Knee 3, 1st at Failsafe 2022, and 1st 
                    at Starstruck. Can he make those regional performances translate to majors?

                    It personally hurts me to put Ben this low as a Minnesotan, but after a decent first 
                    half of the year, he couldn't get it going in the second half of the year. He may have 
                    had the worst controller luck of all time, worse than Leffen, so that's definitely a 
                    factor. After a massive 1st at HTL #7, he couldn't follow that up with any regional 
                    wins, placing 2nd at Run, Don't Walk and Honeypot 4. I have no doubt he can be back 
                    in the top 40 if not higher next year.

                    Chem had a great first half of the year, coming in 3rd at CEO, qualifying him for a 
                    cup we don't talk about anymore. During that run he had wins over SDJ, Krudo, and KJH, 
                    but he couldn't continue that momentum for the rest of the year. He only went to Apex, 
                    SSC, and Shine in the second half of the year and his best win at all of those combined 
                    was Eggy, someone who we saw earlier in the top 100. Hopefully we can see him return to 
                    that killer CEO form.

                    Choosing Pikachu as his new way forward, Ralph's passion for the game has never been 
                    higher. The man who once mained fox is now fully invested in the rat, taking sets off 
                    of SFAT and Spark at regionals and majors, but he's lacked the attendance outside of 
                    NorCal locals to be ranked higher. However, the good news for Ralph fans is that he's 
                    been absolutely killing it at NorCal locals, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him jump 
                    even 30 ranks next year.

                    Grab's been somewhat of a breakout star this year. Coming from a region where there's 
                    not really notable players, this Tennessee Marth has sliced and diced his way to some 
                    super solid performances. His most impressive performance was Shine where he beat Matteo, 
                    DrLobster, and Polish for a 9th place finish, only losing to Jmook and Mango in the 
                    tournament. With his new sponsorship, it seems like we'll be seeing a lot more of him.

                    and ChuDat as well! If he can cut out the losses to players around his rank like Ben, Gahtzu, 
                    Chem, and more, he'll definitely be rising in the future.

                    He's back. He's finally back after over a year and a half hiatus due to COVID. The Kiwi 
                    Marth didn't lose to anyone outside of the top 30 besides 2Saint and SDJ, two Puffs. He's got 
                    great wins on n0ne, Soonsay, and Frenzy, but he just doesn't have the attendance for me to 
                    really evaluate his results hard. He told me he'll be coming back hopefully a lot next year, 
                    and I can't wait to see that.

                    A regional monster in the Northeast this year, DocLob seems to be the sheik ditto 
                    master. In Fact, I think he's only lost one to bonfire10 all year and that's it. Wins over 
                    Jflex, Bbatts, Chem, and Ben are all good, and he's only lost to 2Saint, Franz, Grab, and JoJo.

                    The man who owns one shirt (or many of the same shirt) has been doing what he 
                    always does: Taking names in the PNW. He's got wins on Fiction, Zuppy, and Aura, 
                    while only losing to Medz, Suf, Franz, and a non-ballot loss to Iceman. He's another 
                    person where it's very hard to judge with the lack of attendance to big tournaments.

                    Aaron Thomas may be the love of so many people's lives, but damn is he hard to evaluate. 
                    He's got NO losses to players ranked below him besides a single game 5 last stock loss 
                    to Ben at GOML. But his best win is Trif, who's been relatively inactive this year so 
                    he's even harder to judge! Ugh, what a tough player to rank.

                    Colin is another one of those players that barely met the activity requirement, 
                    so he was REALLY hard to rank. However, he's got wins on Krudo, Skerzo, Logan, and 
                    he's 2-0 on Grab while only having losses to Panda and Komodo at regionals, and 
                    that resume seems good enough to me for a top 60 spot.

                    Our third fox in a row, Azel's been trading sets with a lot of California's best 
                    recently. He's 1-1 Franz, Ralph, and Umarth, but has wins on Lucky, but a losing 
                    record to Kurv. It's an interesting proposition to figure out, and I can't wait to 
                    see him travel more.

                    A long time Luigi main gradually switches to fox and almost makes top 50 in his 
                    first full year with him. That bodes well for the future. 2-0 on SFAT, a Ginger 
                    win, and really good regional wins leads to a good placement for the man with the 
                    umlaut in his name.

                    southern regionals and a few majors. He's picked up wins like Krudo, Skerzo, and 
                    Colbol along the way. However, he's just got to attend more majors and show more 
                    consistency on the loss to move him up even higher.

                    tournament experiences have been more fruitful than many of his other European 
                    counterparts. He's been consistently beating top 40 players at every major he's been 
                    to this year, but his lackluster performances have been in Europe where he's lost to 
                    players like Lil Chief and Kingu. Traveling across to America and still doing this well 
                    is impressive nonetheless, but I'm sure he's not satisfied and we'll see him climb the ladder.

                    because he watched so many gaming youtube videos as a young teenager. One of the 
                    nicest guys in the melee scene, Jean-Christophe Léger-Héroux (one of the best names 
                    in the scene as well), picked up some great wins on Joshman, Magi, Rishi, and more. 
                    Melee Stats has done a great job sponsoring him so we'll definitely be seeing more 
                    of him at events soon.

                    A Doctor Mario in Top 50? Is this 2014? Franz has had an incredible breakout year 
                    where he's beaten many great players like KoDoRiN, Polish, and FatGoku, while not 
                    having many losses. He started traveling at the end of this year, so I'm hoping to 
                    see even more of him. Shoutout to his reverse mains set vs Xela at a local where Xela
                    Xela double caped a stitch face.

                    Basically inactive throughout the first half of the year, we saw Medz's first 
                    outing at Smash Factor 9 where he beat the entire field, including Wizzrobe, before 
                    getting beaten in Grands and the reset by Wizzrobe for 2nd. The rest of the year he 
                    picked up good wins like bobby big ballz and Zamu, but really didn't attend that much.

                    Another player who traveled a lot is Skerzo. It felt like if you saw a tournament 
                    this year, Skerzo probably made top 32. His first half of the year was definitely 
                    really strong, but the second half had some bumps in it like a 65th at Big House 
                    with no notable wins or a 33rd at shine with a loss to Louis. Don't be afraid though, 
                    the Chicago's #1 is going to keep grinding and be back with a vengeance.

                    this year. He attended 6 different regionals, with his best wins being TheSwooper 
                    and Lucky, but he just couldn't make that deep run and pick up some wins at a major 
                    that he needed to move him up the rankings.

                    The most interesting thing to me about Aura this year is that he picked up a 
                    Sheik for some matchups. On top of a secondary, Aura has had a very consistent 
                    year with not many losses to players outside the top 60 besides Nickemwit. 
                    He's got a great moky win and a great Soonsay win, let's see if he can put more 
                    foxes in the blender in 2023.

                     half were great and have aged well, especially the Soonsay and Lunar Dusk wins. 
                     Hopefully he returns to active competitive play soon.

                    We know how good they are, but they didn't attend much. However, they finally did 
                    it: They beat Leffen. After all these torturous years, Trif finally was able to 
                    beat the Swede at Dreamhack Rotterdam 2022. They followed a 3rd place up there with 
                    a 1st at HFLAN and a 1st at Tech Republic VI, a French regional.

                    The third best fox in Canada is known for his trademark aerial double shine and

                    really losing to many players. Only losing to two players off the ballot, one of 
                    them being 100 Grand who would suicide dair him in game 5 last stock on Dreamland 
                    64 in winners quarters of 4M: Minnesota Melee Monthly where the entire crowd popped 
                    off and Zuppy hates that moment and refuses to talk about it. He still won that 
                    tournament anyways, reverse 3-0ing 100 Grand later in bracket and winning 6 sets over 
                    top 100 players in a crazy losers run.

                    Recently announcing his switch to being a Ganon main, Mekk played this entire 
                    year as a Falcon main, and he did not stop… attending events. Hell, he took Greyhound 
                    buses twice up to Minnesota just to attend the monthlies. Having two great wins in 
                    Axe and SluG on top of others is really nice to go with some amazing performances 
                    like Shine.

                    Jflex was a hard one for me to rank. He beat aMSa… but it's at a local. I'm gonna 
                    count the win, but much less than I would if it were a regional or major, but I'm 
                    not counting it against aMSa for losing at all. Other than that, he had a great 
                    Function 2 beating moky, but he's had some other lackluster regional performances, 
                    but he's really shined at majors.

                    Robert Large Testicles was back on his grind again this year. The man with the 
                    most sets played on startgg for 2 years running (can he make it a third this year?) 
                    took some names like n0ne, Krudo, and Magi. However, he also fell to players like 
                    Palpa, Ringler, and DMT. He's all over the place, just like his stream. Let's see 
                    if his 2023 is just as crazy.

                    most of his locals, despite those tournaments mostly being in different states. His 
                    list of ballot wins is 23 long, one of the longest of people outside the top 8 (if 
                    not the longest). All this traveling comes with a lot of losses too, but man do I 
                    have to reward the attendance.

                    and Polish, and hasn't picked up that many bad losses along the way. I wouldn't be 
                    surprised to see him keep up his momentum into 2023.

                    Gio's one of the most likable guys in the smash scene, and he's one of the most 
                    active too. Attending a ton of majors and what feels like almost every local in SoCal, 
                    he's picked up a laundry list of wins that includes n0ne, Ginger, Krudo, and Magi. He's 
                    got some losses like SA Nick, Ober, and Younger that are holding him back from being 
                    higher, but hey, when he attends that much he's bound to pick up some losses.

                    After switching to z-jump, SFAT has a bit of a rougher time this year than in the past, 
                    but he's still his consistent top 30 self. The biggest thing for me not putting him 
                    higher is his lack of a major win. His best win is S2J, who's a great player, but not 
                    near some of the wins that other players above him have. He's capable of beating anyone 
                    though (except maybe Hungrybox), so don't be surprised to see him go even with your 
                    favorite top player.

                    Polish has had a weird year. They overslept twice for majors that they could have possibly 
                    had good bracket paths for. They didn't play Peach for months on end (or sometimes even the 
                    game). But yet, they still had a pretty great year. A win on aMSa, a win on KoDoRiN, and a win 
                    on Fiction are three great points on their resume. Second half of the year had some low points 
                    like losing to Franz with some of the weirdest game endings you'll ever see, but they'll do 
                    amazing things in 2023.

                    Seemingly out of nowhere, SFOP's incredibly technical fox was incredibly consistent in a year where 
                    not many were. Sure, it's a small sample size, which lowers his rank a bit, but when your worst loss 
                    is Aklo and you've got wins over KoDoRiN, Joshman, Krudo, and SFAT? You're off to a great start as a 
                    newly minted top 30 player.

                    suspect losses, including up and comers Palpa, Panko, and Siremeris. She's got a massive 
                    army of fans, don't be surprised to see them cheering her on in 2023 as she gives the puppy the boots.

                    Krudo's year was marked by ups and downs. Wins on iBDW, KoDoRiN, and Joshman are all 
                    amazing, but then he had some losses in the 40-80 range: Panda (who has been beating him in region 
                    solidly), Colbol, Azel, Chem, and Akir (who isn't on the ballot, but would be with more 
                    attendance). If he can gain consistency and get a few more big wins, the man in the Xbox 360 
                    and Faze hoodies' stock could rise.

                    There, he qualified for Summit where he beat Leffen and Pipsqueak AGAIN as well as KoDoRiN. 
                    He's just a major upwards trajectory for 2023, let's hope he can continue that.

                    down in the 2nd half of the year, gaining some less than top 30 losses to Mekk, Skerzo, Kurv, 
                    Dawson, and Gahtzu, and it felt like he needed one more major win to help move him up the ranks.

                    made possible by his strong end of the year. He beat Hungrybox and Mango in back to back 
                    tournaments! Let's see if he can continue his great form into 2023.

                    Finally changing his tag from Sora to Joshman, Australia's representative on an international 
                    stage cemented his spot in the top 20. Beating iBDW and aMSa at GOML in route to a 4th place 
                    finish, he picked up a bunch of other great wins like KoDoRiN, lloD, and moky throughout the 
                    year. However, he's also got a few lower tier losses like Lunar Dusk, and especially JWick 
                    at Genesis 8. But hey, that was the start of the year and he's looked much better in the second half.
                    I hope he recovers fully from his arm injury very soon.

                    Despite being absent for the first half of the year, Wizzrobe had 3 outings and they 
                    were all super consistent. Beating aMSa, Axe, KoDoRiN, and more, he only dropped one 
                    set to a player outside of the current top 8. That set was to Medz, at Smash Factor 9, 
                    his first tournament back that he'd go on to win and double eliminate Medz in Grand Finals. 
                    Who knows what 2023 holds with health issues holding him back, but I wish him a speedy recovery.

                    The only Link appearing on the list (as a secondary), Aklo's come out of his shell and 
                    finally started to travel a bit more outside of the east coast. Ludwig Smash Invitational 
                    saw him beat S2J, Fiction, and Pipsqueak (who beat him earlier). He's also got wins on 
                    iBDW at The Nightclub VIP AND Apex 2022, and doesn't really have that bad of losses. 
                    I'm hoping he travels even more in 2023.

                    n0ne's first half of the year was spectacular, beating Hungrybox at Genesis with the 
                    'Stomp Heard Round the World' and having a 1-0 record on aMSa. However, his second half 
                    of the year wasn't as consistent, where he took some rough losses to bobby big ballz, 
                    Drephen, and Rishi. Yet still, his wins at the top level were too good to be ignored in 
                    favor of a few bad losses.

                    Johnny's year was marked by one major accomplishment: Beating Hungrybox offline for the 
                    first time EVER. He also was able to beat Zain for the first time offline since Battle of 
                    BC 3. With other wins on Axe, moky, and Hungrybox, he's shown that he can beat the players 
                    above him, but he's gotta do it consistently to make himself higher on the list.

                    One of the most technical players in the world, moky's had a great year with amazing peaks

                    but that Hungrybox LAN win has eluded him and he 
                    hasn't shown the ability to beat his Friday stream rival Zain. He got more consistent with 
                    his results towards the end of the year, , which is what he's going to need to keep rising up the ladder.

                    John Ko is known for being an incredibly hard worker. He streams almost every day grinding 
                    melee and trying to improve, and he's had a great year. Wins over Mang0, iBDW, and Hungrybox 
                    are great, but he's missing that consistency and wins that keep him from moving up a few spots.

                    Everyone's favorite Doctor (not Mario) is in at #11. Starting off the year with a super 
                    strong first half with wins over Zain and Leffen, lloD wasn't able to attend much due to, 
                    you know, being a Doctor. He's the best Peach in the world right now, and he's pushing the 
                    character to its limits in a meta where everyone says “Peach can't do it”. I hope he'll 
                    be able to find some time off from his profession to play some more of everyone's favorite 
                    children's party game.

                    Mr. 29 himself is no longer Mr. 29. Axe rose to the occasion the second half of the year, 
                    and showed out. Reinventing his pika play and picking up a pocket fox that's taken it to 
                    Hungrybox, Axe looks hungry. Wins on Zain, Jmook, and Leffen bodes well for his future, 
                    but that elusive Hungrybox win is still evading him. Don't be surprised to see mango be 
                    a roadblock either, even though many of their sets are nail biters. Truly one of the 
                    nicest people in the community, I'd love to see him win a major again.

                    When Wobbling was banned, it seemed like all the notable ICs stopped playing or dropped off 
                    massively. Now, we've got an Ice Climbers main in the top 10. He's shown ability to go toe 
                    to toe with almost anyone, having wins over Zain, Jmook, and Leffen, and bringing Hungrybox 
                    to game 5. However, he's gonna need a little bit of bracket luck if he wants to win his first 
                    major, as he needs to avoid aMSa, cody, and any really good peach.

                    Plup didn't attend much this year, but when he did he made his presence felt. He wasn't able 
                    to win a major this year, but we all know he's capable of it. He didn't really lose to anyone 
                    outside of the top 8 except for Fiction, Ginger, and Magi, signaling that Falco could be a 
                    problem going forward into the future. He's also going to be a serious roadblock to aMSa's 
                    path to #1 if he starts attending again, beating him 25-2 in an online event. When he's on, 
                    he looks like the best player in the world, let's see if he can end there next year.

                    game named Melee. He also showed us he's still capable of winning majors when he won Battle of 
                    BC, but he's gotta be more consistent against the top echelon of players and pick up some more 
                    major wins if he wants to end up higher.

                    performances for the rest of the year, never finishing outside of the top 8 at a major. Jmook's had 
                    incredible consistency and has proven he's capable of beating anyone in the world, even his bracket 
                    demon Hungrybox (who he's had so many painful 2-3 sets with this year). That major win is coming, and everyone knows it.
                    The question is: When is he gonna do it?

                    After a super large slump online in 2021, we saw Hungrybox return to his top-5 level form in 2022. 
                    He got his first major win in a while at GOML and followed it up with another win at Riptide a few 
                    months later. His H2H that sticks out is his 11-1 vs Jmook, but he's gotta figure out a way to flip 
                    the losing H2Hs against all 4 players above him if he wants to be back in pole position.

                    iBDW entered the year as one of the favorites for #1 and he was damn well close for the entirety 
                    of 2022. With arguably best H2Hs at the top level, his biggest reason for him not being higher on 
                    this ranking is due to his string of losses to fox mains outside of the Top 10, as well as less 
                    majors than the top guys. With all that being said, though, he's suffered some incredibly 
                    unfortunate setbacks outside of the game, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him on top next year.

                    less than 1/100 going into The Big House 10. He didn't care, he piloted a mid tier to win the most 
                    stacked open-bracket tournament of all time (along with two other majors this year). With his 
                    move to British Columbia this year, and his seeming willingness to attend locals in the area, 
                    we'll get to see even more of him in 2023. *Bobby Scar voice* A YOSHI!!!

                    Funny how we got to the "Mango/Zain" tier by the end of the year, huh? After Mango finished #11 on the Summer 
                    MPGR, TheCrimsonBlur posed a question that he was asked: "Will Mango ever win a major again?". The answer, was yes. Mango won 
                    four majors in the second half of the year, returning to the form that we all knew he was capable of, even if 
                    we doubted it for a tiny bit of time.

                    The prince who was promised. We all knew it was gonna be him, didn't we? It felt like destiny. After last year's 
                    tiering and him being the #1 online clearly for around a year, he was hunting for that #1 and he finally got it. 
                    After a blistering start to the year, winning Genesis and Pound back to back, he was on the hunt for more, but didn't 
                    find another major win until Shine 2022, in August. Just when people were starting to doubt if he was #1, he won the 
                    Ludwig Smash Invitational, the most stacked event of all time, to seal his second supermajor and fourth major win of the year.
